Vuetify Admin Dashboard is a beautiful resource built over [Vuetify](https://vuetifyjs.com/en/) and [Vuex](https://vuex.vuejs.org/installation.html). It will help you get started developing dashboards in no time. Vuetify Material Dashboard is the official Vuejs version of the Original [Material Dashboard](https://www.creative-tim.com/product/material-dashboard). Using the Dashboard is pretty simple but requires basic knowledge of Javascript, [Vue](https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/), [Vuex](https://vuex.vuejs.org/installation.html) and [Vue-Router](https://router.vuejs.org/en/).

## Few things on the roadmap
* ~~Fix the cards being giant in the dash~~
* ~~add login view~~
* ~~add in auth~~
* user roles 
* ~~log out button~~
* user screen api's
* jwt https cookie storage (still debating since cookies can be hit with xss)
* change route gaurd verification 
* selectable drawer colors 
* notification api so notifications function
* getting documentation up on vue press
* track time since last refresh token

## Bugs
- Notification drawer is currently shifted due to a change in the layout
- Chart js header is not correctly displaying in mobile due to aspect ration change

## Getting Started
- Install Nodejs from [Nodejs Official Page](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- Open your terminal(Shift + right-click in the folder on windows)
- Navigate to the project
- Run `npm install` or `yarn install` if you use [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/)
- Run `npm run dev` or `yarn serve` to start a local development server
- A new tab will be opened in your browser

After installiing the dependencies you can also run additional npm tasks such as
- `npm run build` to build your app for production
- `npm run lint` to run linting.

### Vuetify

Vuetify is developed exactly according to Material Design spec. 

### Vuex

Vuex is a state management pattern + library for Vue.js applications. It serves as a centralized store for all the components.

### Vue-cli

We used the latest 3.x [Vue CLI](https://github.com/vuejs/vue-cli) 

### Special thanks
To [creativetim](https://github.com/creativetimofficial/vuetify-material-dashboard) for the base template 

I added a lot of features to his base template but kept the overall theme/design. Will continue to add more!
